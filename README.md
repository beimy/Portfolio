This is my portfolio website. The goal is to create a responsive site that highlights my work as a web designer. 

When I first designed the site the plan was to include my game design and voice over work as well, making the page a one stop shop for everything about me. The initial design included three large sections dedicated to each of my disciplines. These sections were to be seperated into columns that spanned the width of the webpage. The site would start in the middle of the page with a screens worth of content off to both sides of the page, allowing the user to scroll either left, right or down. 

However, during the creation of the site time quickly sided agaisnst me and I had to scrap my other two sections in order to complete the main site for the purpose of this course.
